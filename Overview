Hardware Requirements:-
1)Arduino Uno board
2)Infrared (IR) sensor (e.g., KY-022)
3)Jumper wires
4)Breadboard
Software Requirements:-
1)Arduino IDE (Download here)
Arduino to IR Sensor connections:-
Arduino Uno    IR Sensor
   GND  ------  GND
   5V   ------  VCC
   A0   ------  OUT
How it Work:-
The Arduino code reads the analog value from the IR sensor connected to pin A0.
The IR sensor outputs an analog voltage which is read by the Arduino's ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) and is then printed to the serial monitor.
